Designed a voltage stabilizer with a series regulation element, ensuring an adjustable output voltage (2V-2.5V) with low thermal drift (<2mV/°C) and high open-loop gain (>200) for stability and precision. The circuit includes short-circuit and thermal protection, limiting the regulation transistor’s temperature to 100°C and the maximum current to 0.4A. Manually calculated component values, performed analytical validation, and simulated the design in OrCAD. Created a PCB layout with SMD components, awaiting fabrication for physical testing.
